This is a small project done by me as a part of the NexForz Ressync recruitment.

This is a text-based, digital contact book, that is made using python, and uses a json file to save all the contacts to persistant storage.
It stores the name, phone number, and email address of all the conatcts as a list of dictionaries.

The modules used in this project are:
1. os - To clear the terminal window.
2. re (Regular Expressions/RegEx) - To validate the contact data input to check is it's on the right format.
3. json - To read and write data to and from the json file used to store all the conatct information.
4. prettytable - To display the contacts in a SQL-table like format

Instructions to run the program:
  • Please use Visual Studio Code or any other IDEs/Interpretors that run the file in a terminal to make sure the program runs as intended.
  • To run the phase 1 and phase 2 program, no additional modules are required.
  • To run the phase 3 and phase 4 program, please install the 'prettytable' module.
