Let's assume the program has these menu options: 1. Add a contact, 2. View all contacts, and 3. Exit program.
The code that performs each action is organised into functions.

1. When the user selects the 'Add a contact' option, the function to add a user will be called. 
2. The user is prompted to input the name, phone number, and email address and this data is stored as a list (eg: [name,number,email]) in a temporary variable.
3. The data in the temporary variable is added to the contacts list.
4. Steps 1 to 3 are repeated as many times as neccessary.
5. When the user selects the 'View all contacts' option, all the data stored in the contacts list is read by the program and output in a readable format.

Criteria for valid user inputs:
1. Name: This can only contain alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase), symbols such as hyphen/minus (-), grave accent/apostrophe (`), period/dot (.) and whitespace ( ).
2. Phone number: This can only contain numbers and has to be ten digits long.
3. Email address: This can only be in the format <user_name>@<domain_name>.<domain>, where:
   a. User name: It can contain alphanumeric characters (uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers) and symbols such as period (.), underscore (_), percentage (%), hyphen/minus sign (-), and plus sign (+).
   b. Domain name: It can contain alphanumeric characters (uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers) and symbols such as period (.) and hyphen/minus sign (-).
   c. Domain: It can contain alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase).
   d. Email format: The format condition (<user_name>@<domain_name>.<domain>) is strictly followed.

Note: The criteria for name and email address are validated with the Regular Expressions (re or regex) module 

Criteria for displaying outputs:
1. Name: Always printed with the titlecase funtion.
2. Phone number and email: Printed as it is.
